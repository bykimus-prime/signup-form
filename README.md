# signup-form

Project from the Odin Project that has me creating a form. This project will use intermediate HTML and CSS that I have been learning throughout this part of the course, and focusing specifically on forms. Form will be created with HTML and stylized with CSS. I haven't learned how to incorporate JavaScript into a form yet.
